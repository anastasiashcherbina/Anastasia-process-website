						<h1>Audience and Goals</h1>
						<p class="info">After researching different aspects around Preemies of the Carolinas,
							I developed goals for each of the audiences I identified earlier.</p>
					</header>
					<h2>Audience</h2>

<p>To define our Audience, we did an exercise where we brainstormed all the possible users of the website and
then organized them into user groups.
This would help us organize people groups and determine goals later on. </p>
<span class="image left">

<img src="img/post-it3.jpg" alt="Post-it Notes"> <br>
<br></span>

<p> This is the product of my brainstorm.
	My user groups were broken down to groups who need help, give help, and groups that are at risk.</p>

	 The Group classified as 'Give Help' is broken down into three main sections that includes; volunteering, funding, and donating.
 <br>
</li>

			<ol><li>Volunteers mostly include students and churches that participate in community service,as well as community service
				clubs, friends and family that help the organization.
			and families who experienced the help of this organization in the past and decided to give back to the community.</li>
			<li>Funding is provided by churches, companies and people willing and able to fund the organization. Family members
			of those who are helped by the organization also contribute with monetary donations.</li>
			<li>Product donations are mostly made by middle aged women who can knit and crochet hats, blankets, and various products. </li>
			<br>
			<br>
			Audience classified as 'Need help' includes families who have premature babies in the NICU.<br>
			<br>
			<ol>
				<li>Families who have premature babies in the NICU, especially those who have to stay
					for a longer period of time. </li>
					<li>Families that are in need are provided support, warm hats, blankets, and clothes for their newborn baby.</li>
				</ol>

	<br>
	<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Audience at risk consists of people who have little ror no interest in this organization. <br>
<br>
<ol>
	<li>People that live outside of the Carolinas that are not aware of this organization, because it is based locally not nationally. </li>
	<li>Families in need that are feel uncomfortable to ask for help. </li>
	<li>Younger generation, highschool students that are not interested in non profit organizations.</li>
	<li>People who have never experienced health related issues, and do not know the struggle of having a baby in the NICU for week, or even months. </li>
</ol>
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<p>To ensure that we meet each user need, we developed overarching goals for the client and audience as well as goals the website should meet. </p>

<h4> Goals Summary</h4>

Creating these goals centered around people sets the website up to meet user and
