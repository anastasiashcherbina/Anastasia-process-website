						<h1>Design Challenge</h1>
						<p class="info">Defining the Design Challenge was the first step. I used the IDEO Human Centered Design Toolkit as a guide to posing questions to find the root problems of the website for users.</p>
					</header> </p>


				<h3> <strong>What is The Problem You Are Trying to Solve?</strong></h3>
<p> To provide crochet items for premature babies in the NICU as a means of comfort and support for the families, and bring awareness to the organization.</p>

<h3><strong>The Design Question</strong></h3>
<p> How can the website promote donations to the charity and involve more volunteers for hands on work? </p>

<h3><strong>The Ultimate Impact</strong></h3>
<p>The goal is to help children & premature babies who will have any type of stay in childrenâ€™s hospitals by
	involving more volunteers and expanding the range of hospitals served by receiving more donations through the website.</p>

<h3><strong>Possible Solutions</strong></h3>
<p>1. Create a call to action that would connect to the needs of the company. <br>
	2. Make the website feel warm and inviting with a baby feel,but without using the generic pink and blue colors. <br>
	3. Add more white spaces and negative space throughout the layout.<br>
4. Change the type to something more sophisticated, as well as kind and gentle at the same time. <br>
5. Imagery should be of good quality and edited cohesively.<br>
6. Follow a specific color palette for all design material.<br>
 7. Create a new logo that could be used at various sizes especially on a small scale. <br>
 8. Create a more simple and organized navigation bar.<br>
9. Appeal to audience and encourage people to donate and volunteer to handmade these items for the charity.<br> </p>

<h3><strong>Context and Constraints</strong></h3>

<p>This charity is only targeting North and South Carolina, and just recently expanded to Hollywood, parts of Georgia, and Florida. The audience is mainly southern,
 even though they receive donations from all over the country, and can ship a preemie packet to any state if they cover shipping costs.</p>

<h3><strong>The Design Question Restated</strong></h3>
<p>How can the re-design website attract more volunteers and encourage people to donate products and participate financially?</p>
<hr>
<p>This excercise got me thinking on person-based design terms. By identifying the roots of the problems and desired outcome, I was able to map out how to take steps towards the solution.</p>
